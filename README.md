<h1>University of Maryland Directed Reading Program 2016</h1>
  This repository contains code created by Adam Anderson with the help of <a href="http://themattinthehatt.github.io/">Matt Whiteway</a> for the <a href="http://drp.math.umd.edu/">Directed Reading Program</a> at the University of Maryland. For the Fall 2016 semester, we will be studying the mechanics of neural networks as we work our way up from programming simple networks from scratch to using some publicly available neural networking libraries.
